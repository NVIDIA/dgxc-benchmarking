# Performance Measurement and Analysis

Performance for LLAMA4 Maverick finetuning is measured by seconds per iteration, or in other words seconds per finetuning step. This metric is logged for every finetuning step in the main finetuning log file [see Output Locations](#output-locations). 

Since the early finetuning steps typically take much longer time (with input prefetch, activation memory allocation, and JIT compilation), we use the `parse_train_timing.sh` script to analyze iterations 11-44 and calculate mean and standard deviation for reliable performance metrics. We also get the achieved GPU FLOPS via `TFLOPS_per_GPU` metric.

### Running the parse_train_timing.sh script

To analyze training timing from your experiment results, run the script from the workload directory. Note, that `LLMB_REPO` is the directory containing the clone of the recipe repository.

```bash
# Basic usage - parses results in the directory named 'experiments' in the current folder
$LLMB_REPO/common/parse_train_timing.sh

# Specify a different experiments directory
$LLMB_REPO/common/parse_train_timing.sh /path/to/experiments

# Output in CSV format
$LLMB_REPO/common/parse_train_timing.sh --format=csv

# Output in JSON format
$LLMB_REPO/common/parse_train_timing.sh --format=json

# Show full filenames instead of shortened versions
$LLMB_REPO/common/parse_train_timing.sh --full-names
```

```shell
Train Step Timing and TFLOPS Analysis (iterations 11-44)
================================================================================
Experiment                                                                         Status Time Mean (s) Time Std (s) TFLOPS_per_GPU Mean TFLOPS_per_GPU Std
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- ------------- ------------ ------------------- ------------------
sft_llama4_e128_bf16_32nodes_tp8_pp1_cp1_vp1_ep32_etp8_mbs1_gbs32_3048691          Success    0.297        0.003              183.71               1.64
```

To obtain throughput as a tokens per second measurement, follow this formula: 
```shell
(sequence length) * (global batch size) / (training_step_timing) = (throughput in tokens per second)
```

E.g. 4096 * 32 / 0.224 = 585143

To calculate time to train estimate:
```shell
(total tokens) / (throughput in tokens per second) / (number of seconds in a day) = (time to train in days) 
```
E.g. 1e12 / 584375 / 86400 = 19.80 days 


To calculate the model flops utilization (MFU):
```shell
MFU = (global batch size) * (model flops) / (training step time) / (number of GPUs) / (peak GPU FLOPS)
```

 The model flops for LLAMA4 Maverick BF16  for GBS=1 is 4.21e14. Calculation shown [here](#notes).

E.g. LLAMA4 Maverick BF16 on 256 B200 GPUs (GBS=32)
```shell
The peak theoretical throughput for B200 BF16 is 2.25 PFLOPS
training step time = 0.224 s
model flops = 4.21e14

MFU = 32 * 4.21e14 / 0.224 / 256 / 2.25E+15 = 10.47%
```

# Prerequisites

A HuggingFace account is required and you will need to [create a HuggingFace access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). Add the generated token to your environment via ```export HF_TOKEN=<your token>```.

Requires Python 3.12.x, or conda.

## Request Access

Access to Llama 4 Maverick must be requested through the [HuggingFace Llama 4](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct). The approval process is not automatic and could take a day or more.

## Slurm

We reference a number of Slurm commands and parameters in this document. A brief summary is included below. It's important to note these are a guide and might not be applicable to all environments. Please consult with your system administrator for the parameters that are specific to your system.

**Common parameters:**
- `SBATCH_PARTITION` or `-p` - Partition (or queue) to use.
- `SBATCH_ACCOUNT` or `-A` - Slurm account to associate with your job, different from your user. Meant for accounting purposes.
- `SBATCH_GPUS_PER_NODE` or `--gres=gpu:<num gpus>` - If your cluster is configured with GRES this should be set to all GPUs in a node. Ignore if not configured.
	- Encountering errors such as 'GPUs not found' or 'Cannot submit to this partition without GPU resources' means this setting is required.

These parameters can be set either by exporting the environment variable or using the corresponding `sbatch` flag.

## Prepare environment

Use the **installer** referenced in the [main README](../../README.md) to prepare the recipe environment:

Note, that a new directory layout and key variables are now used in the recipe:

- `LLMB_INSTALL`: Top-level directory for all benchmarking artifacts (images, datasets, venvs, workloads, etc).
- `LLMB_WORKLOAD`: Workload-specific directory, e.g. `${LLMB_INSTALL}/workloads/finetune_llama4-maverick`.
- Results, logs, and checkpoints are stored under subfolders of `LLMB_WORKLOAD` (see below).


**Migration Note:**
If you previously used `STAGE_PATH`, replace it with `LLMB_INSTALL` (top-level) and `LLMB_WORKLOAD` (workload-specific). All output, logs, and checkpoints are now under `LLMB_WORKLOAD`.

## Prepare Dataset
The LLAMA4 Maverick finetuning uses the SQUAD dataset. The recommended and preferred method to prepare both the dataset and the model checkpoint is by using the **installer** referenced in the [main README](../../README.md).

When the installer runs the setup for this recipe, it will automatically initiate SLURM jobs in the background to download the SQUAD dataset and import the Llama-4 Maverick checkpoint. Please note the following:
-   These SLURM jobs are essential for setting up your environment and may take some time to complete. The installer finishing does not mean these jobs are complete.
-   These jobs require GPU resources. Ensure your SLURM partition has available GPUs.
-   To verify that the checkpoint and dataset have been downloaded successfully, refer to the [Storage Requirements and Verification](#storage-requirements-and-verification) section.

### Manual Checkpoint and Dataset Download (Troubleshooting Only)

If you encounter issues with the automated download via the installer, or if you only need to re-download specific components, you can use the manual instructions provided in the "[Manual Checkpoint and Dataset Download (Troubleshooting Only)](#manual-checkpoint-and-dataset-download-troubleshooting-only)" section at the end of this document. This method is intended for troubleshooting purposes only.

# Run Finetuning

Once the environment has been prepared, it is time to train a model. The finetuning runs for the first 50 steps and then stops. Log files and results are stored under the `${LLMB_WORKLOAD}/experiments/` folder (see Output Locations for details).

## Using llmb-run (Recommended)

The easiest way to run benchmarks is using the llmb-run launcher tool. This method handles configuration automatically and provides a streamlined interface.

```bash
# Navigate to your installation directory
cd $LLMB_INSTALL

# Run a benchmark with llmb-run
llmb-run single -w finetune_llama4-maverick -s 400b --dtype fp8 --scale 256

# Example with BF16 precision
llmb-run single -w finetune_llama4-maverick -s 400b --dtype bf16 --scale 256
```

For more details on llmb-run usage, see the [llmb-run documentation](../../llmb-run/README.md).

## Direct Method

Alternatively, you can run finetuning directly using the launch script. This method provides more control over individual parameters and environment variables.

**Important**: 
- Ensure your virtual environment is activated before running the finetuning commands below. If you used the installer with conda, run `conda activate $LLMB_INSTALL/venvs/<env_name>`. If you used the installer with python venv, run `source $LLMB_INSTALL/venvs/<env_name>/bin/activate`.
- Run the launch script from the recipe directory: `cd $LLMB_REPO/llama4/`

### Command Template

```shell
JOB_TOTAL_GPUS=<number> GPU_TYPE=<type> [DTYPE=<precision>] [MODEL_SIZE=<size>] ./launch.sh
```

### Environment Variables

**Required:**
- `JOB_TOTAL_GPUS`: Number of GPUs to use (e.g., 256)
- `GPU_TYPE`: Type of GPU hardware
  - `b200` - NVIDIA B200 GPUs
  - `h100` - NVIDIA H100 GPUs

**Optional:**
- `DTYPE`: Precision format (default: `bf16`)
  - `fp8` - FP8 precision
  - `bf16` - BFloat16 precision
- `MODEL_SIZE`: Model variant (fixed: `400b`)
  - `400b` - 400 billion parameter model (only supported size)

### Example Commands

Train LLAMA4 Maverick with BF16 precision on 256 B200 GPUs:
```shell
JOB_TOTAL_GPUS=256 DTYPE=bf16 GPU_TYPE=b200 ./launch.sh
```

Train with FP8 precision on 256 B200 GPUs:
```shell
JOB_TOTAL_GPUS=256 DTYPE=fp8 GPU_TYPE=b200 ./launch.sh
```

Train on 256 H100 GPUs with FP8 precision:
```shell
JOB_TOTAL_GPUS=256 DTYPE=fp8 GPU_TYPE=h100 ./launch.sh
```

# Output Locations

All benchmark results are saved under `$LLMB_WORKLOAD/experiments/` with the following structure:

```text
experiments/
├── <experiment_name>/
│   └── <experiment_name>_<timestamp>/
│       ├── <experiment_name>/
│       │   ├── log-<experiment_name>.out      # Main finetuning log with performance data
│       │   ├── sbatch_<experiment_name>.out   # Batch script output  
│       │   └── nsys_profile/                  # Profiling output (when enabled)
│       │       └── *.nsys-rep files
│       └── [batch scripts and other files]
```

The `<experiment_name>` typically follows the pattern: `sft_llama4-maverick_400b_<dtype>_<scale>_<config>`

**Key files:**
- `log-<experiment_name>.out` - Contains training step timing and performance metrics analyzed by `parse_train_timing.sh`
- `nsys_profile/` - Contains profiling traces when `ENABLE_PROFILE=true`

# Run Nsight Profiling

To enable profiling with Nsight Systems set variable `ENABLE_PROFILE=true` when submitting your job. The job will run for a total of 50 steps where steps 45-50 will be profiled.

In order to view the resulting profiles, ensure you have the latest version of Nsight Systems installed. For more information visit: [Nsight Systems](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/)

### Profiling job details:
* **MPI Ranks:** 0-8
* **Job Steps:** 45-50
* **Output Location:** Profiling output saved alongside finetuning results (see Output Locations)
* **Filename format:** `profile_${SLURM_JOB_ID}_nodeId_rankId.nsys-rep`

**Example command:**
```shell
ENABLE_PROFILE=true JOB_TOTAL_GPUS=256 DTYPE=bf16 GPU_TYPE=b200 ./launch.sh
```


### Customizing profiling behavior:
* Specify job steps to profile:
	* `PROFILE_START_STEP`: start profiling on this job step.
	- Default: 45
	* `PROFILE_STOP_STEP`: stop profiling on this job step.
	- Default: 50

### Viewing results

In order to view the profile traces (*.nsys-rep files) interactively:
- Install the latest [Nsight Systems client](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/get-started) on your preferred system
- Copy the generated .nsys-rep files to a folder on your preferred system. E.g., /home/nsight-traces/
- Open Nsight Systems client, then click "File | Open" and select one or more .nsys-rep files from /home/nsight-systems folder. For more details, see [Reading Your Report in GUI guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/UserGuide/index.html#opening-an-existing-report).
- Once loaded you can analyze the workload behavior to learn about any performance bottlenecks associated with the model or the job run. 

Since most of the benchmarking jobs run on multiple GPUs, there will be multiple .nsys-rep files generated for each run. [Multi-Report Analysis Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/UserGuide/index.html#multi-report-analysis) will be very helpful to automate the analysis and get to results quicker by using Nsight recipes.

**See** these [tutorials](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/get-started#tutorials) to get a quick start if you are new to Nsight profiling.

## Run NCCL Trace (For Debugging)

NCCL traces are a tool for understanding communication patterns within your benchmarking job. They provide detailed information on the types of NCCL calls being made (like AllReduce, Broadcast, etc.) and the size of the messages being exchanged.

**Important:** This feature is primarily intended for **troubleshooting and debugging purposes only**. It is not typically used during normal benchmark runs.

To collect NCCL Trace information, set the environment variable `ENABLE_NCCLTRACE=true` when submitting your job:

**Defaults for Tracing:**
*   **Duration:** Due to the large file sizes generated, tracing is limited to the first 5 steps of the job by default.
*   **Output Location:** NCCL trace information is included directly within the standard job log file (see Output Locations)

**Example command:**
```shell
ENABLE_NCCLTRACE=true JOB_TOTAL_GPUS=256 DTYPE=fp8 GPU_TYPE=b200 ./launch.sh
```

### Understanding NCCL Trace Results

Enabling NCCL tracing will generate a large volume of log messages labeled "NCCL Info". These messages provide details about individual communication operations. Be aware that these log files can be quite large, potentially exceeding 1GB.

Look for messages including:

```
"NCCL INFO AllReduce: opCount"
"NCCL INFO Broadcast: opCount"
"NCCL INFO AllGather: opCount"
"NCCL INFO ReduceScatter: opCount"
```

**Example Log Entry:**

```
[7] NCCL INFO AllReduce: opCount 2 sendbuff 0x7ffb4713c200 recvbuff 0x7ffb4713c200 count 1 datatype 1 op 0 root 0 comm 0x55556b100660 [nranks=128] stream 0x5555630c58b0
```

This example shows an `AllReduce` operation with details about the buffers, count, data type, and the participating ranks.

# Storage Requirements and Verification

**Note:** The LLAMA4 Maverick checkpoint is approximately **747GB** in size, which requires significant storage space. Ensure your file system has sufficient space (at least 1TB recommended) to accommodate the checkpoint, dataset, and temporary files.

To verify that the checkpoint and dataset have been correctly downloaded and are available, check for the following directory structure and file contents within `${LLMB_WORKLOAD}/checkpoint_and_dataset/` after the installer's setup tasks have completed:

```text
checkpoint_and_dataset/
├── datasets/          # Dataset files
├── hub/              # HuggingFace hub cache
├── models/           # Model checkpoints (~747GB)
└── nemo_nlp_tmp/     
```

Within the `datasets/` folder, you should find the SQUAD dataset under `squad/` with the following contents:
```text
datasets/
└── squad/
    ├── text_0.0.0_7b6d24c440a36b6815f21b70d25016731768db1f.lock
    ├── packed/
    ├── squad/
    ├── test.jsonl
    ├── training.jsonl

    ├── training.jsonl.idx.npy
    ├── validation.jsonl
    ├── validation.jsonl.idx.info
    └── validation.jsonl.idx.npy
```

Within the `models/` folder, you should be able to find the downloaded checkpoint under `meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct/` with the following structure:
```text
models/
└── meta-llama/
    └── Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct/
        ├── context/
        └── weights/

            ├── __0_1.distcp    # 374GB
            ├── common.pt
            └── metadata.json
```

# Manual Checkpoint and Dataset Download (Troubleshooting Only)

These instructions are provided for troubleshooting purposes, in case the automated download via the installer encounters issues. This will kick off up to two - 1 Node 1 GPU SLURM jobs to perform the download.

### Activate Virtual Environment
Before running the `download_ckpt_dataset.sh` script, you must activate the virtual environment associated with the `finetune_llama4-maverick` workload. This environment contains the necessary dependencies for NeMo to run the download process.

To find the correct virtual environment path, consult the `cluster_config.yaml` file located in your `${LLMB_INSTALL}` directory. Look under the `workloads.config.finetune_llama4-maverick.venv_path` key.

Once you have the `venv_path`, activate it using one of the following commands, depending on whether it's a `venv` or `conda` environment:

*   **For `venv` environments:**
    ```bash
    source <venv_path>/bin/activate
    ```
*   **For `conda` environments:**
    ```bash
    conda activate <venv_path>
    ```

### Important Environment Variables
The `download_ckpt_dataset.sh` script relies on several environment variables that are typically set by the installer. When running this script manually, you must ensure these variables are set in your environment:

*   `HF_TOKEN`: Your HuggingFace access token. (e.g., `export HF_TOKEN=<your token>`)
*   `GPU_TYPE`: The type of GPU hardware you are using (`b200` or `h100`). (e.g., `export GPU_TYPE=h100`)
*   `LLMB_INSTALL`: The top-level installation directory for all benchmarking artifacts. (e.g., `export LLMB_INSTALL=/path/to/llm_benchmarking_install`)
*   `LLMB_WORKLOAD`: The workload-specific directory. This is usually derived from `LLMB_INSTALL`. (e.g., `export LLMB_WORKLOAD=${LLMB_INSTALL}/workloads/finetune_llama4-maverick`)
*   `SBATCH_ACCOUNT`: Your Slurm account. (e.g., `export SBATCH_ACCOUNT=your_slurm_account`)
*   `SBATCH_PARTITION`: The Slurm partition (queue) to use. (e.g., `export SBATCH_PARTITION=your_partition`)
*   `SBATCH_GPUS_PER_NODE`: If your Slurm partition requires GRES set to at least one. (e.g., `export SBATCH_GPUS_PER_NODE=1`)
*   `TIME_LIMIT`: The default is 55 minutes. Increase this value if you experience timeouts, particularly if your network speed is slower. Use the `HH:MM:SS` format (e.g., `export TIME_LIMIT=01:30:00` for 1 hour and 30 minutes).

### Download Commands
Once these environment variables are set, you can use the following commands to manually download the checkpoint and/or dataset:

```shell
# Download both checkpoint and dataset
./download_ckpt_dataset.sh

# Download only dataset (skip checkpoint import)
SKIP_IMPORT_CHECKPOINT=true ./download_ckpt_dataset.sh

# Download only checkpoint (skip dataset download)
SKIP_DATASET_DOWNLOAD=true ./download_ckpt_dataset.sh
```

**Note:** The SLURM jobs initiated by these commands are 1 Node 1 GPU jobs and may take some time to complete. Refer to the [Storage Requirements and Verification](#storage-requirements-and-verification) section to confirm successful download.

# FAQ

**Q: Why does my CUDA Graph job keep running after finetuning completes and eventually get terminated by SLURM?**

A: This is expected behavior with CUDA Graph jobs. The jobs may continue running for some time after completing the finetuning process and will be terminated when the SLURM timeout is reached. You may see messages like:

```
No transition in N5Agent6Client3FSM8Profiler8ShutdownE (1) for N5Agent6Client3FSM9InterruptE.
slurmstepd: error: *** STEP 602263.2 ON prenyx0025 CANCELLED AT 2025-06-25T05:58:06 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
```

This is normal behavior and does not indicate a problem with your finetuning run. The finetuning results and logs will still be valid and available in the output directory.

# Notes

Model Flops: 
12*GBS*(seq Length)*(num of layers)*(hidden size)*(hidden size)*((1+(number of query group)/(number of head)+0.5*(seq length)/hidden size)+((FFN Hidden Size)/(Hidden Size))*1.5*(Top K)+(Vocab Size)/2/(num of layers)/(hidden size))

Model Flops breakdown:
  attention flops = 12 * GBS * (seq length) * (number of layers) * (hidden size)^2 * (1 + (number of query group)/(number of head) + 0.5*(seq length)/hidden size) 


  mlp flops = 12 * GBS * (seq length) * (number of layers) * (hidden size)^2 * ((FFN Hidden Size)/(Hidden Size) * 1.5 * (Top K))

  embedding flops = 12 * GBS * (seq length) * (number of layers) * (hidden size)^2 * (Vocab Size / (2 * (number of layers) * (hidden size)))

  - FFN Hidden Size: 16384
  - Number of heads: 40
  - Number of Experts: 128 
  - TopK: 1
  - Number of Query Groups: 8

    Attention flops = 12 * 4096 * 48 * (5120)^2 * (1 + (8/40) + 0.5*(4096/5120))
        = 9.88e13

    MLP flops = 12 * 4096 * 48 * (5120)^2 * ((16384/5120) * 1.5 * 1)
       = 2.96e14

    Embedding flops = 12 * 4096 * 48 * (5120)^2 * (202048 / (2 * 48 * 5120) = 2.54e13

    model flops = 98803960709120 + 296421782127360 + 25377267428675  = 4.21e14
